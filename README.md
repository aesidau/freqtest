freqtest
========

Here are two simple Java applications to explore and illustrate the questions posed in my blog post at http://www.aes.id.au/?p=991

* FreqTest.java - looks at the impact of different sample freqencies on maximum error in cents over the range of notes A3 to F7.
* SecondFreqTest.java - looks at the impact of different note ranges on maximum error for sample frequencies 44.1kHz and 48kHz.
